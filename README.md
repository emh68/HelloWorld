# Overview

This is a basic Hello World program, with a slight twist. I created this to demonstrate the use of a text-to-speech synthesizer using Python code and
the pyttsx3 text-to-speech module.

I wanted to have a little fun with the traditional Hello World program. The program asks the user for their name and then prints their name and speaks their name and asks them a famous line from the movie "War Games"-- "Would you like to play a game?"
